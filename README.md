# PACMEN
Factory for Making PacMen
Given: a starter.html.

When the button "make one" is pressed one PacMan is created. To do that, we need to complete the code. 
Also, we need to write code to position the new PacMan image and add it to the "game" div. 
It is then added to the array of PacMen, which keeps track of the position and the velocity of each PacMan.
We need code to make the PacMen bounce off any wall it hits. 
Start by getting at least one PacMan positioned and viewable.
